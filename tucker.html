    Tucker was born in Atlanta, Georgia, to Mary Louise (Bryant) and Norris Tucker, who owned a janitorial service.
     After graduating from high school, Tucker made a change to move to Hollywood from Georgia to pursue a career in
     show business. He found himself a frequent guest on the Def Comedy Jam (1992). Tucker was noted for doing
      exceptionally "clean", non-vulgar stand-up comedy routines. Tucker states his inspirations for comedy are Eddie
       Murphy and Richard Pryor.

Tucker made his film debut in House Party 3 (1994), along side stars such as Bernie Mac, Marques Houston, and
 Khandi Alexander. In 1995 Tucker appeared in one of his most notable and hilarious films, Friday (1995), alongside
 Ice Cube. Tucker's character, Smokey, was a drug addict who was an energetic and outlandish person. Films such as
 Friday (1995) showed Tucker's television-comedy styling was very different from his stand-up. In 1995, Tucker also
 appeared in in another film, Dead Presidents (1995).
